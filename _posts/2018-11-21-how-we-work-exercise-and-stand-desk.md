# How We Work: Exercise and Stand Desks

## Why

The culture of our engineering team here at ITProTV encourages healthy habits. We all enjoy taking
care of our bodies, so why wouldn't we want to do the same at work! The two main ways we do this is
through, you guessed it, team exercise and stand desks. There is a lot of research out there on what
improves work place morale, but for us these two elements help our team be the happiest and most
productive we can be.

## Team Exercise

This element of our work day occurs at the 50th of every hour between eight and five. We have a
Slack reminder and when we see that we know it's time to get moving. The exercises we do vary day
to day because we generally get sore. Some of the exercises include:

- Push-ups
- Crunches
- Lunges

I know it sounds like a lot to do it every hour, but we have seen quite a few benefits of this:

1. Wakes us up and gets our blood pumping
1. Allows a break from the code we are writing
1. Increased productivity

**Crazy Stat!** As a team we have done over 20,000 push ups since June 28th, 2018.

This experiment has positively effected our team here. With taking just a few extra minutes a day,
we increased our work completed by 17% for a 4 month span. We have also allowed other ITProTV 
employees join our slack channel and together we keep each other accountable to following a health
life style.

### Stand Desk

When I started here at ITProTV, the engineering team had recently received stand desks, so for me
it's the norm. The reasons leadership invested were unclear to me, but I wasn't complaining. I
loved the flexibility and usefulness these desks offered.

After working here for a few months, I found out that the leadership team invested in stand desks
to

As a team, our use of the stand desk varies. I don't stand, but maybe a few times a day and
generally use a balance board, while one of my coworkers stands a majority of the day. If you've
read our previous [post](http://engineering.itpro.tv/2018/10/24/how-we-work-pair-programming/) on
pair program, you know that we spend a lot of time at a pairing station that is also a stand desk,
so we tend to agree to stand or sit for a given pairing station.

As I mentioned above, there is a lot of research out there on the benefits of stand desks, but the
biggest benefits for our team are:

1. Less stiff and stagnant
1. Better posture
1. Being prepared to fight any ninjas who may come into our space!

These benefits really help us stay healthy and get moving as a team. Together with exercising, our
morale stays positive and we continue to see our productivity increase.
