# Promiscuous Pairing Is a Success

By Jason Fry (@JasonMFry)

Inspired by @arlobelshee's [Promiscuous Pairing paper][], we embarked on our own experiment on
2018-10-16. Before then we paired roughly 80% of the time (see [previous post on pairing][]) so we
were familiar with pairing but we had a lot of room to grow.

## Benefits

First, the data. We have 1-week sprints from Tuesday to Tuesday. We decided our experiments would be
for 4 sprints. The data below is for our first experience with promiscuous pairing, from 2018-10-16
to 2018-11-13. Our team is small: 5 software engineers and 1 lead engineer who pairs roughly half of
the time. Our professional software engineering experience is as follows: 6 months, 2 years, 3
years, 4 years, 8 years, and 13 years.

Note that the experiment here was just trying to figure out promiscuous pairing. We went into this
experiment expecting it to take some time before it paid off, if it paid off at all. Boy were we
wrong...in a good way :smile:

### Data

<!-- add before and after data from clubhouse -->

### Anecdotal Benefits

<!-- list anecdotal benefits, such as "feel more knowledgeable of our codebase", etc -->

## Complications

Though the experiment was an overwhelming success, there were complications that we had to address.

### Scheduling

<!-- our company standup is 0830, making our morning 3 hours -->

### Passing Context

<!-- got better very quickly, though difficult the first week -->
