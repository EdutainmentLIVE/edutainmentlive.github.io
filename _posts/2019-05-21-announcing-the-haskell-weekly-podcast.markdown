# Announcing the Haskell Weekly podcast

by Taylor Fausak (@tfausak)

I am excited to announce the [Haskell Weekly podcast][]!
As the name suggests,
it is a weekly podcast about the [Haskell programming language][].
We select interesting articles from the [Haskell Weekly newsletter][] to talk about.
Each episode uses a conversational two-host format,
typically with me and another [ITProTV][] engineer.
We try to keep episodes short,
so they run for about 15 minutes.
We publish new episodes every week.

Subscribe now in [Apple Podcasts][] or [Google Podcasts]!
